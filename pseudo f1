Initialize total_score to 0
Initialize number_of_innings to 0

Repeat until explicitly terminated:
    Display "Enter number of runs scored (-1 to finish) : "
    Try:
        Read input as score
        If input is not an integer:
            Display "Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer."
            Continue to the next iteration
    Catch ValueError:
        Display "Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer."
        Continue to the next iteration

    If score is equal to -1:
        Exit the loop

    Increment number_of_innings by 1
    Add score to total_score

If number_of_innings is equal to 0:
    Display "No valid score entered"
Else:
    Calculate average_score as total_score divided by number_of_innings
    Display "The average runs scored is: " followed by average_score with two decimal places
